# Teaching scripts

I have uploaded Python and MATLAB scripts that I have developed in the course of teaching several courses at NC State. You are free to use anything that you like but here are a few warnings: 
+ They are meant for teaching, so not optimized
+ They do not extensively cite the literature and sources
+ Come with no warranties
