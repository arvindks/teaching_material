    "We want to write a function `equal(a, b)` for determining if two strings `a` and `b` are equal. If equal, the function returns True and the string a. If not equal, the function returns False and a string displaying the differences. This latter string contains the characters common in a and b, but for every difference, the character from a and b are written with a pipe symbol ’|’ in between. In case a and b are of unequal length, pad the string displaying differences with a * where one of the strings lacks content. For example, `equal('abc', 'aBc')` would return False, 'ab|Bc', while `equal('abc', 'aBcd')` would return False, ’ab|Bc*|d’. Here is the test function:"
