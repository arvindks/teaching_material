    "+ The solutions may be in the form of code, markdown, or a combination of both. Make an effort to present the solutions in a clean fashion.\n",

    "An important feature of programming is to write functions to test the behavior of the functions (methods) that you will implement. In these exercises, for each function that you implement you will have to write a test function. The function will be named ```test_<function name>()``` and will not take any arguments. This will be a part of *unit testing* which we will also explore in future lectures.\n",
