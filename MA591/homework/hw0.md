## Homework 0

### Instructions
This homework is basically a checklist of all the software you need for this course and sets up some of the infrastructure for DSA courses. The assignment is worth 0 points.

### Tasks
1. Locate your shell. See [instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html). 

2. Install git. See [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). If you are using Linux/OSX, chances are you already have git installed. Type `$ git help` at the shell prompt to verify your installation. 

3. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). A lighter version of Anaconda is [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). If you're debating between the two, here is some [information](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda) to help you decide. 

4. Ensure that you are using Python 3.x by typing `$ python` at the shell. You will see something like 
```
$ python
Python 3.7.3 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jul  1 2019, 14:38:56) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 

```
In this case, the version is 3.7.3.

5. Ensure that you have installed [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/index.html). Instructions for installation using `conda` is available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

6. This year's data science academy courses are part of an education study about data science pedagogy. You were asked to fill out a form regarding your consent to participate or not in that study. You will be granted extra credit if you fill out that form (regardless of how you respond): this is a reminder to fill out the form. Here is another [survey]( https://forms.gle/YqTQVPEeX9wM6wrK9) that asks you to reflect on data science.
