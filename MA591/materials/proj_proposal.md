## Project proposal

This is due 11/14 5 PM by email asaibab@ncsu.edu with the title 'DSC 495 (014): Project Proposal'. This will count for 3 bonus points towards HW 8. 

1. Which project option do you plan to pursue? See [link](https://github.ncsu.edu/asaibab/dsc495_014_fall2022/blob/main/materials/projects.pdf).
2. If you're proposing your own project, please give the appropriate details (see link above). You need written approval from the instructor to implement this project. 

Feel free to setup an appointment to discuss either option.
